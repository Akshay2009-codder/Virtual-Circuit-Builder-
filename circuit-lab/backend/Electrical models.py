"""
Maps each catalog component to a simplified DC electrical model, used by the
MNA (Modified Nodal Analysis) solver in simulate.py. This is a teaching-level
model, not a full SPICE engine - documented simplifications below.

Every two-terminal part falls into exactly one bucket:

  ZERO_RESISTANCE - wire, fuse, inductor (DC steady-state = short), and a
                     closed switch/DIP switch. Terminals are electrically
                     merged into the same node.

  OPEN            - capacitors (DC steady-state = fully charged = open),
                     an open switch/DIP switch, and unmodeled active/logic
                     parts (transistors, MOSFET, 555/op-amp ICs) - we don't
                     simulate their internal behavior, so they simply don't
                     conduct between their two exposed terminal points.

  RESISTOR        - a normal linear resistor between its two terminals.
                     Includes real component values (resistor, potentiometer,
                     LDR, thermistor, speaker impedance) and two assumed
                     typical values noted below where the catalog only
                     stores a rated voltage, not a datasheet resistance.

  DIODE           - an ideal diode with a fixed forward-voltage drop
                     (LED, diode, zener). Terminal "a" is the anode (+),
                     "b" is the cathode (-) - matches the +/- markers shown
                     in the Builder. Conducts only when forward biased.

  SOURCE          - an ideal DC voltage source (battery, solar panel, dev
                     board power rail, or a voltage regulator's fixed
                     output). Terminal "a" is positive, "b" is negative.
